\title{Absorbtion of Single Photon Energy in Media}
\description{
    This function calculates how photon energy decreases during interaction with media.
}
\usage{
Absorb(myObject)
}
\arguments{
  \item{myObject}{The mandatory parameter of this function is the MCBS class created by \code{\link{MCBS}} constructor function.}
}
\details{
    The \code{Absorb} function, alias \code{Absorb.MCBS}, calculates the new energy level after interaction event in the media. If photon energy falls below 0.001, a roulette algorithm makes decision when photon has 10\% chance to survive with higher energy and 90\% chance to loose all energy. Please keep in mind, that photons start with \code{weight = 1} but the first interaction happens at boundary, where photons enter the media.
}
\value{
    The \code{Absorb} function returns an MCBS object as \code{\link{class}}. Typically the same object is used in argument and result.
    One parameter of a single photon is updated in this procedure:
    \item{weight}{photon energy. Its initial value is 1 and decrease according to the albedo.}
}
\note{
    Please note that this function is designed to be used in \code{\link{Simulation}} function. You may use it separately in case you design your own procedure. In such a case, please note that function \code{\link{Randomize}} prepares trajectory data for each photon and iterations are done using move index \code{myObject$midx}. Function \code{Absorb} uses random data in roulette algorithm to make decision about photon survival at low energy level.
