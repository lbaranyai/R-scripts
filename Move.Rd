\title{Moves Single Photon in Media}
\description{
    This function calculates the move of single photon in media.
}
\usage{
Move(myObject)
}
\arguments{
  \item{myObject}{The mandatory parameter of this function is the MCBS class created by \code{\link{MCBS}} constructor function.}
}
\details{
    The \code{Move} function, alias \code{Move.MCBS}, calculates updated position coordinates \code{c(x,y,z)} according to the motion vector \code{c(u,v,w)} and the travel length until next interaction event.
    The movement of single photon is calculated in 3 dimensional space. The length of the straight section a photon can travel until the next interaction event is estimated as \code{-log( rnd )} where \code{rnd} is a uniformly distributed random variable from range 0-1.
}
\value{
    The \code{Move} function returns an MCBS object as \code{\link{class}}. Typically the same object is used in argument and result.
    As a result, the 3D position of the photon is updated:
    \item{x}{position along x-axis}
    \item{y}{position along y-axis}
    \item{z}{position along z-axis, the depth}
}
\note{
    Please note that this function is designed to be used in \code{\link{Simulation}} function. You may use it separately in case you design your own procedure. In such a case, please note that function \code{\link{Randomize}} prepares trajectory data for each photon and steps are done using move index \code{myObject$midx}.
